When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on a project that involves many project members so everyone can have easy access to the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because allowing git to pull changes automatically could result in the presence of unwanted commits or branches on my local repository.
